// The physical process module simulates a physical process that could be measured/sampled
// by a sensing device on the nodes. Different sensing devices (e.g temperature, pressure,
// light, acceleration) would be represented by distinct PhysicalProcess modules. A node
// simply ask the process for a sample which is returned as soon as it is calculated.
